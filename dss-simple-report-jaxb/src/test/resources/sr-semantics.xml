        <PolicyDescription>Validate electronic signatures and indicates whether they are Advanced electronic Signatures (AdES), AdES supported by a Qualified Certificate (AdES/QC) or a
                Qualified electronic Signature (QES). All certificates and their related chains supporting the signatures are validated against the EU Member State Trusted Lists (this includes
                signer's certificate and certificates used to validate certificate validity status services - CRLs, OCSP, and time-stamps).
