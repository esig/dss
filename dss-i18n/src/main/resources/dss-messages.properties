# Semantics (ETSI TS 119 102-1 V 1.2.1 (table 5)
SEMANTICS_TOTAL_PASSED=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-PASSED based on the following considerations: the format check succeeded; the cryptographic checks of the signature succeeded (including checks of hashes of individual data objects that have been signed indirectly); any constraints applicable to the signer's certificate have been positively validated (e.g. the signing certificate consequently has been found trustworthy); and the signature has been positively validated against the validation constraints and hence is considered conformant to these constraints.
SEMANTICS_TOTAL_FAILED=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because the format-check failed, cryptographic checks of the signature failed (including checks of hashes of individual data objects that have been signed indirectly) or it has been proven that the signing certificate was invalid at the time of generation of the signature.
SEMANTICS_INDETERMINATE=The available information is insufficient to ascertain the signature to be TOTAL-PASSED or TOTAL-FAILED.

SEMANTICS_PASSED=The validation process succeeded
SEMANTICS_FAILED=The validation process failed

# Semantics (ETSI TS 119 102-1 V 1.2.1 (table 6)
# TOTAL-FAILED
SEMANTICS_FORMAT_FAILURE=The signature is not conformant to one of the base standards to the extent that the cryptographic verification building block is unable to process it.
SEMANTICS_HASH_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because at least one hash of a signed data object(s) that has been included in the signing process does not match the corresponding hash value in the signature.
SEMANTICS_SIG_CRYPTO_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because the signature value in the signature could not be verified using the signer's public key in the signing certificate.
SEMANTICS_REVOKED=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because: the signing certificate has been revoked; and there is proof that the signature has been created after the revocation time.
SEMANTICS_EXPIRED=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because there is proof that the signature has been created after the expiration date (notAfter) of the signing certificate.
SEMANTICS_NOT_YET_VALID=The signature validation process results into TOTAL-FAILED because there is proof that the signature was created before the issuance date (notBefore) of the signing certificate. 
# INDETERMINATE
SEMANTICS_SIG_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because one or more attributes of the signature do not match the validation constraints. 
SEMANTICS_CHAIN_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the certificate chain used in the validation process does not match the validation constraints related to the certificate. 
SEMANTICS_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_GENERAL_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the set of certificates available for chain validation produced an error for an unspecified reason. 
SEMANTICS_CRYPTO_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because at least one of the algorithms that have been used in material (e.g. the signature value, a certificate...) involved in validating the signature, or the size of a key used with such an algorithm, is below the required cryptographic security level, and: this material was produced after the time up to which this algorithm/key was considered secure (if such a time is known); and the material is not protected by a sufficiently strong time-stamp applied before the time up to which the algorithm/key was considered secure (if such a time is known).
SEMANTICS_POLICY_PROCESSING_ERROR=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because a given formal policy file could not be processed for any reason (e.g. not accessible, not parseable, digest mismatch, etc.).
SEMANTICS_SIGNATURE_POLICY_NOT_AVAILABLE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the electronic document containing the details of the policy is not available. 
SEMANTICS_TIMESTAMP_ORDER_FAILURE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because some constraints on the order of signature time-stamps and/or signed data object(s) time-stamps are not respected. 
SEMANTICS_NO_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_FOUND=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the signing certificate cannot be identified. 
SEMANTICS_NO_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_FOUND=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because no certificate chain has been found for the identified signing certificate. 
SEMANTICS_REVOKED_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the signing certificate was revoked at the validation date/time. However, the Signature Validation Algorithm cannot ascertain that the signing time lies before or after the revocation time. 
SEMANTICS_REVOKED_CA_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because at least one certificate chain was found but an intermediate CA certificate is revoked. 
SEMANTICS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_NOT_REVOKED=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the signing certificate is expired or not yet valid at the validation date/time and the Signature Validation Algorithm cannot ascertain that the signing time lies within the validity interval of the signing certificate. The certificate is known not to be revoked. 
SEMANTICS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the signing certificate is expired or not yet valid at the validation date/time and the Signature Validation Algorithm cannot ascertain that the signing time lies within the validity interval of the signing certificate. 
SEMANTICS_REVOCATION_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because the signing certificate of the revocation information of the signature signing certificate is expired or not yet valid at the validation date/time and the Signature Validation Algorithm cannot ascertain that the revocation information issuance time lies within the validity interval of the signing certificate of that revocation information. 
SEMANTICS_CRYPTO_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because at least one of the algorithms that have been used in objects (e.g. the signature value, a certificate, etc.) involved in validating the signature, or the size of a key used with such an algorithm, is below the required cryptographic security level, and there is no proof that this material was produced before the time up to which this algorithm/key was considered secure. 
SEMANTICS_NO_POE=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because a proof of existence is missing to ascertain that a signed object has been produced before some compromising event (e.g. broken algorithm).
SEMANTICS_TRY_LATER=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because not all constraints can be fulfilled using available information. However, it may be possible to do so using additional revocation information that will be available at a later point of time. 
SEMANTICS_SIGNED_DATA_NOT_FOUND=The signature validation process results into INDETERMINATE because signed data cannot be obtained.
