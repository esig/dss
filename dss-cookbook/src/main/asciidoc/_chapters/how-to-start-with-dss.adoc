[[HowToStart]]
== How to start with DSS

=== Integration instructions

The section explains the basic steps required to successfully integrate the DSS components to your project.

==== DSS Core

This section explains the usage and build requirements for https://github.com/esig/dss[DSS framework].

===== Requirements

The latest version of DSS framework has the following minimal requirements:

* Java 8 or higher (tested up to Java 21) is required for usage;
* Java 11 or higher is required for the build. Java 15 is the minimal requirement for a build with unit tests;
* Maven 3.6.3 and higher (if build required);
* Memory and Disk: see minimal requirements for the used JVM. In general the higher available is better;
* Operating system: no specific requirements (tested on Windows and Linux).

Starting from version `6.0`, DSS uses `jakarta.\*` namespace naming of Specification API. If your application uses `javax.*` namespaces, please use version `5.13`.

NOTE: We strongly recommend using the latest available version of JDK, in order to have the most recent security fixes and cryptographical algorithm updates. We also recommend to use JDK 17+.

WARNING: Before processing the integration steps, please ensure you have successfully installed Maven and JVM with a required version.

===== Adding as Maven dependency

====== Using Maven Central (starting from version 5.11.1)

The simplest way to include DSS to your project is to use https://central.sonatype.dev/namespace/eu.europa.ec.joinup.sd-dss[Maven Central repository]. To do this you need to define the required modules within a list of dependencies in `pom.xml` file of your Maven project, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>eu.europa.ec.joinup.sd-dss</groupId>
        <artifactId>dss-xades</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
----

NOTE: The integration with Maven Central repository is available for versions starting from 5.11.1 and 5.10.2.

See <<MavenModules>> to get familiar with the available modules in DSS.

Refresh your project in order to download the dependency and you will be able to use all modules of the DSS framework. Your project needs to be refreshed every time you add a new dependency.

For integration with `dss-bom` module, please see <<BomModule>>.

====== Using Nexus repository (version 5.11 and before)

To include DSS artifacts published to Nexus Repository (versions up to and including DSS 5.11), the following configuration is required within `pom.xml` file of your Maven project:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
	  <id>cefdigital</id>
	  <name>cefdigital</name>
	  <url>https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/artifact/content/repositories/esignaturedss/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

After that you will need to specify a list of DSS modules required for your project (see <<BomModule>> as an example).

[[BomModule]]
====== Integration with Bill of Materials (BOM) module

As DSS represents a multi-modules framework that benefits users from a more effective way of using the library (include only what you need), it has a downside that makes it difficult to keep versions of all modules up-to-date. The "bill of materials" (BOM) solution, represented by `dss-bom` module, helps other projects with the "version management".

The root `pom.xml` of `dss-bom` defines versions of all modules within DSS-library. Other projects that wish to benefit from the solution in DSS, should import `dss-bom` module using `dependencyManagement` and load other required modules without the need to define a version for each dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>eu.europa.ec.joinup.sd-dss</groupId>
            <artifactId>dss-bom</artifactId>
            <version>6.0.1</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>eu.europa.ec.joinup.sd-dss</groupId>
        <artifactId>dss-utils-apache-commons</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>eu.europa.ec.joinup.sd-dss</groupId>
        <artifactId>dss-xades</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ...
    <!-- add other required modules -->
</dependencies>
----

See <<MavenModules>> to get familiar with the available modules in DSS.

[[MavenBuildProfiles]]
===== Maven build and profiles

In order to use a customized bundle of DSS, you may want to build the DSS Core framework modules.

NOTE: If you have implemented a new feature or fixed a bug issue, your pull requests are welcome at our https://github.com/esig/dss[GitHub Repository]

A simple build of the DSS Maven project can be done with the following command:

----
mvn clean install
----

NOTE: All listed commands must be executed from the project directory via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

This installation will run all unit tests present in the modules, which can take more than one hour to do the complete build.

In addition to the general build, the framework provides a list of various profiles, allowing a customized behavior:

* *quick* - disables unit tests and java-doc validation, in order to process the build as quick as possible (takes 1-2 minutes). *This profile cannot be used for a primary DSS build* (see below).
* *quick-init* - is similar to the `quick` profile. Disables java-doc validation for all modules and unit tests excluding some modules which have dependencies on their test classes. *Can be used for the primary build of DSS*.
* *slow-tests* - executes all tests, including time-consuming unit tests.
* *owasp* - runs validation of the project and using dependencies according to the https://nvd.nist.gov[National Vulnerability Database (NVD)].
* *spotless* - used to add a licence header into project files.

WARNING: Some modules (e.g. `dss-utils`, `dss-crl-parser`, etc., see ch. <<SpecificModules>>) have to be built completely, as other modules are dependent on their test classes. Therefore, for the first build of DSS, the profile `quick-init` should be chosen rather than `quick` profile.

In order to run a build with a specific profile, the following command must be executed:

----
mvn clean install -P *profile_name*
----

===== Documentation generation

In order to generate HTML and PDF documentation for the DSS project, the `dss-cookbook` module of the DSS Core must be built with the following command (please, ensure that you are located in the `/dss-cookbook` directory):

----
mvn clean install -P asciidoctor
----

===== Javadoc generation

In order to generate https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/apidocs/index.html[HTML Javadoc], you will need to build the DSS Core completely.

[[DSSDemo]]
==== DSS Demonstrations

This section explains the build and use requirements for the https://github.com/esig/dss-demonstrations[DSS Demonstration Applications].

===== Requirements

The minimal requirements to build/run DSS Demonstrations:

* Java 17 or higher (tested up to Java 21) is required;
* Maven 3.6 or higher (if build required);
* Tomcat 10 or higher (for Web-application);
* Memory and Disk: see minimal requirements for the used JVM. In general the highest available is the best;
* Operating system: no specific requirements (tested on Windows and Linux).

NOTE: Since DSS `6.0`, the minimal requirement to use `dss-demo-webapp` has been increased to JDK 17, because of Spring-Boot 3 migration.

===== Ready to use solutions

[[DSSWebApp]]
====== DSS Web Application

The ready to use webapp allows testing the different functionalities offered in DSS without needing to dive into the implementation.

The DSS demo is available online on the https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/home[DIGITAL website].

The DSS demo is also available as a ready to use downloadable webapp. To use it, you need to complete the following steps:

. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/DIGITAL/Digital+Signature+Service+-++DSS[Download] the webapp as a ZIP folder.
. Unzip the folder
. Click on the Webapp-Startup.bat file
. Wait until this message appears "Server startup in xxx ms"
. Click on the DSS-Web internet shortcut

[[DSSStandaloneApp]]
====== DSS Standalone Application

DSS provides a standalone application which uses JavaFX. The application does not require a server to publish the product. The application can be run locally on a client's machine.

Download links for the Standalone Application (Windows x64):

* https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/downloads/dss-app-minimal-windows-x64.zip[Minimal ZIP (application + bat file)];
* https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/DSS/webapp-demo/downloads/dss-app-complete-windows-x64.zip[Complete ZIP (application + bat file + OpenJDK + JavaFX SDK)].

===== Maven build instructions

The build of the project can be done similarly to the DSS Core framework build with the command `mvn clean install`.

NOTE: Please ensure that you build modules that you really need. Ignore build failures for non-required modules.

====== DSS Web Application build

To build the DSS Web Application the following modules are provided:

* `dss-demo-webapp`;
* `dss-demo-bundle`.

`dss-demo-webapp` represents a Spring-Boot application, allowing to build the application either in a `war` package (default option, to be deployed in a Tomcat Server), or in an executable `jar` package.

To build a `jar` package, the following command shall be used:

.Maven command to build a jar package
----
mvn clean install -P jar
----

If you continue with a default `war` packaging option, you may benefit from `dss-demo-bundle` module, encapsulating the created package within a Tomcat 10 bundle. After a successful build, in the directory `/dss-demo-bundle/target/` you will be able to find two containers: `dss-demo-bundle.zip` and `dss-demo-bundle.tar.gz`. Despite the different container type, the content of both containers is the same. After extracting the content, you will need to run the file `Webapp-Startup.bat` in order to launch the server and the file `Webapp-Shutdown.bat` to stop the server. After running the server, the web-application will be available at the address `http://localhost:8080/`.

If during TL/LOTL loading you experience problems with some particular Trusted Lists, please refer the <<KeyStore>> chapter for a resolution.

The documentation and javadoc will be copied automatically (limited to `war` packaging) from the built DSS Core and made available on the following addresses respectively:

* HTML documentation : `http://localhost:8080/doc/dss-documentation.html`;
* PDF documentation :  `http://localhost:8080/doc/dss-documentation.pdf`;
* Javadoc : `http://localhost:8080/apidocs/index.html`.

In order to build a bundle for JDK 21, the following profile can be used from the `dss-demo-bundle` module:

.Maven command to create a JDK 21 bundle
----
mvn clean install -P java21
----

====== Integration tests

The `dss-demo-webapp` module provides a collection of integration tests in order to test the behavior of REST/SOAP web-services. In order to run the tests, a web-server with the DSS Web Application shall be launched and the following profile needs to be executed from the module:

----
mvn clean install -P run-integration-test
----

====== DSS Standalone Application build

In order to build the standalone application, the following modules are required:

* `dss-standalone-app`;
* `dss-standalone-package`.

If the build is successful, you will be able to find out the following containers in the directory `/dss-standalone-app-package/target/`:

* `dss-standalone-app-package-minimal.zip` - contains the application code. Requires JDK ad JavaFX installed on a target machine in order to run the application;
* `dss-standalone-app-package-complete.zip` - contains the application code, as well as JDK and JavaFX library code. Can be run on a machine without pre-installed libraries.

In order to launch the application, you will need to extract the archive and run the file `dss-run.bat`.

[[SpecificModules]]
==== Specific modules

Some modules of the DSS framework have a specific behavior and has to be handled accordingly.

DSS contains a bundle of JAXB-based modules, generating Java classes at runtime based on XSD-schema. When any change is made in the XSD, the classes of the module are being re-generated according to the change. The following modules present this behavior:

* specs-xmldsig;
* specs-xades;
* specs-trusted-list;
* specs-validation-report;
* specs-asic-manifest;
* specs-saml-assertion;
* dss-policy-jaxb;
* dss-diagnostic-jaxb;
* dss-detailed-report-jaxb;
* dss-simple-report-jaxb;
* dss-simple-certificate-report-jaxb.

Specific modules with JWS and JAdES specifications exist. These modules allow to validate the generated JSON against the related JSON Schema :

* specs-jws;
* specs-jades.

Also, as it was explained in the previous section, some modules are required to be built completely in order for their dependent modules to be built when using a quick profile, namely:

* <<dssUtils,dss-utils>>;
* <<dssCrlParser,dss-crl-parser>>;
* dss-test;
* <<dssPades,dss-pades>>;
* dss-asic-common.

The modules contain common interfaces, used in other DSS modules, as well as unit tests to ensure the same behavior between their implementations.
