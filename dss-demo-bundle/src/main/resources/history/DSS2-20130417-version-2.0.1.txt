The dss-package version 2.0.1 fixes the following issues:
- CAdESService
The class did not properly use the provided SignatureParameters and instead signed always with SHA-1. 
This has been changed in the sources (because in the demonstration webapp only SHA-1 is used).
- signature.jsp
The construction of the URL used to connect to the services on the server was partially hardcoded.
It is now fully based on the JSP request parmeters:
  final String serviceUrl =
    request.getScheme() + "://" +
    request.getServerName() + ":" +
    request.getServerPort() +
    request.getContextPath() +
    "/service";
- Mocca Integration
The module "sscd-mocca-adapter" was not present in the sources.
This has been added.
The root-pom reference was put in comments, as the compilation requires dependencies that are not provided.
According notes have been added to these comments.

In addition, structural changes for the package have been introduced:
- dss-licences
This contains the DSS and third-party licences.
- dss-webapp-full
This is the standalone web application with dedicated JDK/JRE (1.6.0_22-b04) and Tomcat server (6.0).
- dss-src
This contains the Maven based sources. Specific markers have been added for "dss-itext" precisely stating the applied changes.
